selium programming:
rules
...(means or)

.rewrite things in reverse


basic goal:(
create a  programming langauge that works on the "or" "principal"
example : writing a paragram...we dont use spacing but the "or" command

i "or" have "or" a "or" cat
which will print out : i have a cat


basica goal 2:
write things in reverse
i.e instead of style="background-color;color:white"it will be 


basic rule 3:
when u write something then u are allowed to add something else.
dont know what it means but u need to figure it :) lol

code sample:
write >>>
the write function allows u to do somethinng : replaces javascript's
<script>
</script>
almost like if..this then do this.also the arguments comein pairs like
if u say green then that green must go to turn blue...then u 
add another if statement then u are required to add another complimentry
"do this"...the program wont work if u dont ...follow the above "syntax/rule"
i.e change a of text color or something


u also need to compliment: in order to execute the code
syntax: complement:
equivalent: printout("")


symbols: for insert images:
i.e syntax: symbol("");
equivalent : img=src=""


important number for importing :
i.e important number numpy
equivalent : import numpy


when they is a wrong syntax entered ..the whole line is highlighted in black.

sythenx: (2)
explanation: enter the synthex (2) in order to to tell the program that u are done write the prograam
equivalent to : exit() or return 0

synthex: symbol
explanation:this is how you comment in the program
equivant to: // or <!--comment-->


synthex: show imbalance
explanation: this command shows the number of steps on the right and the number of steps on the left and if they arent equal then the code is deemed imperfect
i.e 

1|90
sorry this code is imperfect ....

synthex: if you love me
explanation: this command replaces and acts as the if statement
equivalent to : if

sythenx:// 
explaination : this commend whilist used in  other programming languages as a commemt
not really shows a comment in selium but instead...allows an individual to see all the
double mistypes i.e if i keyed in hello hello then this is flagged or shown

sythex: gui
explaination: this commend shows the selium programming "cheat sheet" on the rigthen
side of the panel with the cheat sheet written in yellow on the above left top when
the window panel is opened

sythex: <stylish></stylish>
explainantion: so this will feature and host all the commands as a place whereby
all imports are 
i.e  <stylish style this>
import selium red wine: import tool for  using color/enabling color to be used and applied
import word count : this allows scans the program texts under the <p></p> tags or tags
and suggests/evaluates whether  a paragraph length is missing word length or packs a 
puch
import copy: enables the copy function
import find: a tool that allows u too locate a keyword or code
</stylish or style this>


sythex: i dont understand this- or i dont under this
exlaination-function: mmm...it prompts an ai to do a code review of the entire code
base and fixes and touches up any errors.in collaboration with im confused which
performs an undo function and runs the program code base to show what errors are
shown in the command prompt

sythex: <stylish> import copy</stylish>
function:to enable the copy funcion

sythemx: style-list
function: mmm....shows and allows one to reuse already used style line codes in the
already present in the consolole i.e 


sythenx: style-line 2
function: mmm....allows one to use two styles on the same line 
equivalent to: <span></span>


sythex: fa fa search
function: allows one to search for and use fa-fa icons

synthex: inspect
function: takes to and highlists the line of code inputted or in the console
using yellowish fait orange color and comes with the match double sythex

sythex : match...done...increase...line(pushes words to the end of the line)...i cant see(returns back to the current /previous line u were working on)
function: this /these functions allow u to do the following :

how to use: highlight with ur cursor and and then enter the words "prompt"
which will show u the 


sythenx: im tired,<stylis>import im tired</stylish>
function: saves work and logs of the console to in order to run debugging



sythex: partners
function : finds duplicate lines of code or words or paragraphs similiar to ..and errors

sythenx:box
function: 
equivalent: <div></div>

end goal1: license this programming tool: i.e if someone or institition
makes to teach it they need to pay a licensable fee.
consult with yatchts-security team/yatchts-os department(our software  enforcers) law"
end goal2: sell the program on retail shelves or software platforms i.e applestore,
google play etc...or our own
end goal3: become like the linux alternative code base programming ide for linux
and Yatchts OS or softwares
endgoal4: make the program sythex intuive to use (by using everything words people
common people use in order to foster easily adaptivability to the coding) in order
to sell to primary kids and colors


logic: behind the program mentality?: mmmm...the more a programmer or someoone has
to do or complete the more they actually complete or do.so no granting anything for 
granted
who 


nuts n bolts:
to use colors u use the <stylish>import colos: blues;</stylish>
