  <h1><u>what inspired me:</u></h1>
  
  i was inspired by instagrams toxic environment<br>
  and wanted to create a fun ,less toxic place.
  
  
  
  <h1><u>Our business model:inspired by instagram</u></h1>
  
  i was like ,since instagram is a place for, flexing<br>
  the obscene number of wealth u have what<br>
  would be a bigger flex than to having<br>
  pay to follow,post,<br>
  upload,comment,like,etc...thats a bigger flex,actually spending money<br>
  
  <h1><u>other inspirations: Microsoft</u></h1>
  
  i was inspired by microsoft,especially by mr <br>
  bill gates.what specifically inspired me, was their<br>
  ui,design.Most of their products are<br>
  usually goodly designed,except the cloud business ,which<br>
  in my opinion is a business most ordinary people<br>
  dont care about much, as they would rather store<br>
  their files locally than have them stored <br>
  somewhere remote and rarely use it ,in conclusion<br>
  it is a business i would ,rather stay away from<br>
  ...but if i was to venture /dubble in it i would <br>
  call it Freaky Storage By A Distance.also ,additionally by the fact that<br>
  originally i wanted to build something to sell to Microsoft<br>
  (originally i wanted to work for them-i still do,but only because i want their team to <br>
  help me design Pink Flower Messaging System(a whatsapp Alternative)).  <br><br>
